I am a Junior full stack developer, looking for a role where I can extend my coding skills and contribute to this world becoming a better place. After graduating from University of Peloponnese's Computer Science department I worked as a Computer Science teacher and 360o Digital Marketer. 
In 2017, I decided to learn more about good programming practices in agile environments and join Maker's Academy, a 4 months coding bootcamp focusing on learning how to learn, TDD development and XP values.

Curious about technology and life, in my free time [I create photographs](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mormolis/albums/), play the guitar and learn new things.
