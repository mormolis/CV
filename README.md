I am a former Computer Science teacher and 360o Digital Marketer. Combining a strategic and analytical mind, with a big smile and a positive attitude, I decided to pursue the closest we have to superpowers, and create awesome stuff made out of code, as a professional software engineer this time. 

Having worked with people and machines for the past 6 years, I had the opportunity to develop a balanced relationship with both aspect of a developer's life. 

I am always curious about technology and life and in my free time [I create photographs](https://flickr.com/users/mormolis), play the guitar and sing (out of tune most of the time).

I believe that actions are way more valuable than words therefore [my code will speak for itself](https://github.com/mormolis) ;)
